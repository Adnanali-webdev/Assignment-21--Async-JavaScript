1) Demonstrate JavaScript's Single-Threaded Nature

 Question:

 Write an example to show that JavaScript is single-threaded by creating two competing tasks, one that
 blocks the event loop and another async function that waits for a promiseB


2) Why Does JavaScript Not Execute Asynchronously by Default?

 Question:

 JavaScript is often called synchronous and single-threaded, yet it handles asynchronous tasks like AJAX
 requests, timers, and event listeners.
a) Explain why JavaScript does not execute asynchronously by defaultB
b) Write a code snippet to prove that JavaScript is inherently synchronousB


3) Chaining Promises with setTimeout

 Modify the delay function to chain multiple promises so that three messages are logged in sequence with
 delays
4) What are the different states of a Promise, and how do they transition?
5) How does the JavaScript event loop handle Promises differently from setTimeout?
